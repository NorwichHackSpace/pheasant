# Pre Hospital Emergancy App Site and Network

#Install

- yarn install
- yarn dev

Will run on:
http://localhost:3000

# Todo

- Make sidebar more configurable. Its pretty good with the pages.js include but could be easier to customise and add more items.
- Theme names must be added to an array in ThemeToggler which is annoying, I think it can come from pallete
- Add a app config that can set the default theme.
- App config needs to save settings to local storage
- config - app title

# Customisation

- Theme settings: theme\palette.js
- Sidebar: layouts\Dashboard\components\Sidebar\Sidebar.js
- Links in sidebar: layouts\Dashboard\components\Sidebar\pages.js
